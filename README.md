# Fantasy Curling

## Introduction
Fantasy Curling is a small program I wrote for a job programming exercise.

## The Task
The Task can be found [here](http://jstest.monterosa.io/)

## Requirements
The project was built on top of nodejs `v10.15.0`. While other versions may work, this is the only version it has been tested on.

This project has a series of requirements due to it being built in react.

## Setup
All requirements can be installed via NPM or YARN using `npm install` or `yarn` from the project directory. To run the program, simply run the command `npm start` or `yarn start`.
